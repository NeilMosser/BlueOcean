# Overview
Thumbs Up is a fullstack web application for connecting riders with drivers in their area. Drivers are able to plan trips and approve or decline requests from riders to join. Riders are able to search for nearby trips and request a seat.
The goal of Thumbs Up is to provide rides to those without access and reduce fuel costs, carbon emissions, and traffic through carpooling.
